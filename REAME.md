Project Overview:

The primary objective of this project is to predict the number of bike rentals based on historical data, including temporal, weather, and seasonal factors. The project uses various machine learning techniques to analyze patterns and make accurate predictions.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

a.Date/Time: Timestamp of the observation.

b.Weather Conditions: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather category.

c.Seasonal Factors: Information about the season and holiday status.

d.Bike Rentals: The target variable indicating the number of bikes rented.The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling to ensure robust model performance.

Steps in the Project:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized patterns in bike-sharing demand.
Explored correlations between features and target variable.

2.Feature Engineering:

Extracted useful features such as day, month, and hour from the timestamp.
Encoded categorical variables.

3.Model Building:

Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models including:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R^2 score.

Prediction and Insights:

Predicted future demand based on new data.
Provided actionable insights for resource allocation.
